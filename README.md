My rock stations playlist
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can find a m3u playlist that includes some of the stations I listen to currently.
This playlist intended to be used with IPTVSimple PVR addon for XBMC but probably will work with any player that support m3u playlists.  
I also included links to the stations' homepages in the m3u.  

As my preferences always changes this  playlist isn't constant,  
I would greatly appreciate any suggestion and recommendation on rock stations, just open an issue.
